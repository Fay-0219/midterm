The main body and main colors followed the requirements, but some minor changes were made to the details.
    1. Changed the secondary color to beach color to better fit the theme and background.
    2. The entire Contact is placed in a black border, making it more reasonable visually and intuitively.
    3. Center the footer to make it more eye-catching.
